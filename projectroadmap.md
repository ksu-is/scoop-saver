# Project Roadmap – Scoop Saver

## Phase 1: Sprint 1 Tasks
- [x] Submit project idea and mark as "Go" in Teams spreadsheet
- [x] Create GitHub repo under ksu-is
- [x] Set up README.md with project description
- [x] Join GitHub organization and set up GitHub Desktop
- [ ] Research similar Pygame project (e.g. Tech with Tim tutorial)
- [ ] Test tutorial code and document issues
- [ ] Customize basic version with new assets

## Codebase Research
I reviewed [Tech With Tim’s Pygame tutorial](https://github.com/techwithtim/Pygame-Tutorials?files=1). It includes:
- Basic game loop structure
- Player movement with keys
- Sprite handling
- Collision detection

### Evaluation:
✅ Easy to follow  
✅ Compatible with Python 3 and Pygame  
✅ Modular structure is useful for expansion

### Notes:
- Code runs well locally after installing Pygame (`pip install pygame`)
- Plan to adapt sprite mechanics and scoring system

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)
- [ ] Replace character graphics with ice cream cones and scoops
- [ ] Add good vs. bad scoops logic
- [ ] Build lives and score system
- [ ] Add sound effects
