# Project Roadmap â€“ Scoop Saver

## Phase 1: Sprint 1 Tasks
- [x] Submit project idea and mark as "Go" in Teams spreadsheet
- [x] Create GitHub repo under ksu-is
- [x] Set up README.md with project description
- [x] Join GitHub organization and set up GitHub Desktop
- [x] Research similar Pygame project (e.g. Tech with Tim tutorial)
- [x] Test tutorial code and document issues
- [x] Customize basic version with new assets

## Codebase Research
I reviewed [Tech With Timâ€™s Pygame tutorial](https://github.com/techwithtim/Pygame-Tutorials?files=1). It includes:
- Basic game loop structure
- Player movement with keys
- Sprite handling
- Collision detection

### Evaluation:
âœ… Easy to follow  
âœ… Compatible with Python 3 and Pygame  
âœ… Modular structure is useful for expansion

### Notes:
- Code runs well locally after installing Pygame (`pip install pygame`)
- Plan to adapt sprite mechanics and scoring system

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)
- [x] Replace character graphics with ice cream cones and scoops
- [x] Add good vs. bad scoops logic
- [x] Build lives and score system
- [x] Add sound effects
## Testing Tutorial Code â€“ Sprint 1

âœ… Ran Tech With Tim's Pygame movement tutorial successfully  
âœ… Pygame window opened with a movable rectangle character  
âœ… Arrow keys worked for movement  
âœ… No errors occurred  
ðŸŸ¡ Next steps:
- Replace rectangle with ice cream cone sprite
- Add scoops falling from the top of the screen
- Track score and lives
- 
## Sprint 2 Tasks
- [x] Replace rectangle with cone sprite for player
- [x] Add falling scoop sprites (good and bad)
- [x] Implement collision detection for scoops
- [x] Add score tracking and display
- [x] Add lives tracking and display
- [x] Add sound effects for good/bad scoops
- [x] Scale images to fit game window
- [x] Refactor code for readability
## Emerging Tasks
- [ ] Add instructions/start screen
## Sprint 2 Progress
- Player and scoop images now display at correct size
- Sound effects play when scoops are caught
- Score and lives update correctly
- Code is committed regularly to GitHub with clear messages
