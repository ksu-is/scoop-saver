# scoop-saver
A simple arcade-style game where the player controls an ice cream cone and tries to catch falling scoops while avoiding bad ones. The game gets faster over time, includes sound effects, and tracks your score. Built using Python and Pygame. Fun and great for casual players/kids.
## Overview

**Scoop Saver** is a fun, arcade-style game where you control an ice cream cone at the bottom of the screen and try to catch falling scoops of ice cream. The more scoops you catch, the higher your score — but beware! Not all scoops are sweet. Catching a bitter or rotten scoop will cost you a life, and after three lives… it’s game over!

This game is designed for kids and casual players looking for a simple offline game — something like the Chrome dinosaur game. It features colorful visuals, sound effects, score tracking, and increasing difficulty as scoops fall faster over time. Players use the left and right arrow keys to move the cone.

**Scoop Saver** is built with Python using the beginner-friendly `pygame` library. It’s a great way to practice core programming concepts such as:
- Game loops and animations
- Collision detection
- Sound integration
- Keyboard controls
- Game logic and UI elements

To kickstart development, I’m using an open-source tutorial from *Tech with Tim* as a base, which I will then customize with my own design, assets, and features.

This is a solo or two-person project, developed as part of my Python course to practice Agile project management and collaborative development using GitHub.
